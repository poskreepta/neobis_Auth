# Authentication App
This is the readme file for the Auth iOS application. The application includes modules for authentication, registration, password validation, and token management. Application built using UIKit follows the MVVM - C architectural pattern. All UI components are created programmatically without using Interface Builder.

The UI components are programmatically created to adhere to the design specifications.
